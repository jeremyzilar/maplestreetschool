<h4>Paragraphs</h4>
Each book contains five simple, often humorous, sometimes poignant, short stories chronicling the exploits of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog" title="Frog - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">frog</a> and his friend, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad" title="Toad - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">toad</a>, simply named Frog and Toad. Some of their adventures include: attempting to fly a kite, cleaning Toad's messy house as opposed to waiting until "Tomorrow" to do so, and figuring out the ethics of being "Alone".

The two protagonists do carry specific traits about their personalities and appearance. Frog is taller, with a green shade, and is more friendly and relaxed than Toad; Toad is shorter and stout, with a brown shade and also the more serious and irritable of the duo.

In 2008 three of Arnold Lobel's uncolored, unpublished, Frog and Toad books were discovered in an estate sale. They were consolidated into two books and colored by Lobel's daughter Adrianne Lobel; however these books appear to be very different from the original set.
